Tableau visualisation project as part of Udacity's DAND.

## Summary

A look into the delays of domestic flights in contiguous US from 2013-2017. We find that the number of flights have gone down over the years, along with that less flights being delayed. However, the total delay minutes decreased by a lower percentage, meaning delayed flights are generally delayed longer.

Data used is from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236).

## Design

- Minimal colours, refrain from visual overload

- Map, visual volume and delay of flights around various airports

- Line graphs, display changes over time

- Bar charts, display total count or total value

- Simple line to show decrease in overall flights and delay

## Feedback

### [V1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jabez.tay#!/vizhome/ContiguousUSFlightsv1/ContiguousUSFlights2013-2017)

#### 1

- Simple and elegant design, very easy to read, understand and derive insights
- Potential improvement ideas: For the 3rd slide, maybe you can add a trendline to highlight the downward trend of over-an-hour delay percentage? Maybe you can give more charts for the last slide so that it's balanced? Also, it is not immediately clear what the chart is about...

#### 2

- some story point have too much info, is it possible to separate the graphs? usually for business presentations only one graph a page

### [V2](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jabez.tay#!/vizhome/ContiguousUSFlightsv2/ContiguousUSFlights2013-2017)

#### 3

- too general, not specific enough to my needs
- should follow through, i.e. if i choose a certain airport on the first slide, it should continue to show me insights for the selected airport throughout the rest of the slides, since i have an interest in only that particular airport
- could be more specific and show me carrier information

#### 4

- the data takes awhile for me to understand
- the units in the graph can be clearer

#### 5

- in the chart 4M = 4 minutes?
- 3rd shows percentage falling, but 4th shows percentage actually stays same (monthly vs yearly)

### [V3](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jabez.tay#!/vizhome/ContiguousUSFlightsv3/ContiguousUSFlights2013-2017?publish=yes)

#### 6 (Project submission review)

- be more clear on figures between first and second story points
- add summary to communicate findings

### [V4](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jabez.tay#!/vizhome/ContiguousUSFlightsv4/ContiguousUSFlights2013-2017)

#### 7 (Project submission review 2)

- written summary outside of tableau needs to be touched up
- could elaborate findings in captions
